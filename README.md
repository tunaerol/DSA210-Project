## Project Overview
This project explores my daily YouTube usage patterns to uncover insights into how the platform influences my lifestyle and well-being. By tracking when and why I watch YouTube (e.g., during meals or late at night), I aim to identify habits and youtube's impact on key aspects of my life.

Specifically, the project will:

- Analyze hourly patterns of YouTube usage to identify peak usage times and correlations across days.

- Investigate the relationship between late-night YouTube viewing and its effects on both sleep quality and sleep duration.

Ultimately, the goal is to understand my personal YouTube habits better and make informed adjustments to improve my overall health and daily routines.

## Motivation
Recently, I noticed that I felt bored during meals when I wasnâ€™t watching videos on YouTube, sometimes even when I had company. This realization made me question how much I rely on YouTube in my daily life and whether it might be affecting other aspects of my life.

When brainstorming project ideas, I became curious about the potential negative impacts of my YouTube habits. Specifically, I wanted to explore how late-night YouTube usage might influence my sleep quality and duration. Additionally, I saw an opportunity to analyze patterns across days, identifying correlations and trends in my viewing behavior.

This project is driven by a desire to better understand my habits and their effects, with the ultimate goal of fostering a healthier balance between digital consumption and overall lifestyle.
## Dataset  
This project relies on two datasets: **YouTube watch history** and **my sleep patterns**.  

### 1. YouTube Watch History  
- **Source**: Extracted from Google Takeout in JSON format.  
- **Content**:  
  - Includes details such as video titles, links, and timestamps (date and time when each video was watched).  
  - Other fields, such as titles or links, are not directly relevant to the analysis and will not be used.  
- **Usage**:  
  - Focus on the timestamp data to identify when I am most active on YouTube throughout the day.  

### 2. Sleep Patterns  
- **Source**: Collected using the **Sleep as Android** app, which monitors sleep habits through audio recordings and tracks sleep and wake times.  
- **Content**:  
  - Sleep quality: A calculated score based on factors like movement and noise during sleep.  
  - Sleep duration: The length of time between falling asleep and waking up.  
- **Usage**:  
  - Compare sleep quality and duration with YouTube usage patterns, especially late-night activity, to identify potential correlations.
